2018-01-26 10:17:14,298 p=3003 u=student |  ERROR! Syntax Error while loading YAML.


The error appears to have been in '/home/student/troubleshooting/samba.yml': line 8, column 30, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

    install_state: installed
    random_var: This is colon: test
                             ^ here
